####steps for learning some jquery

1. find out what jquery is for (google or wikipedia should be sufficient here)
2. determine a project which would be a good application for this new thing (even just for testing purposes.)
3. find a jquery cheat-sheet
4. plan out the project, researching the parts that will be needed on stack overflow or other resource
5. since it's new, test often, and research when something isn't working.
6. take a break after an hour or so, unless having too much fun.


####results

1.finding some info and cheat sheets was easy
2.picking a seemingly appropriate project wasn't too hard either
3.that said, it seems like selectnig things using the DOM is rather more flexible... it feels like I'm writing js code, and then trying to translate it to jQuery, which is taking more time and not being helpful!
4. having a quick way to pick "add this function to all divs with class "square" has proved handy, but using the jQuery within the javascript should be easier!
5.overall, something to keep thinking about...
