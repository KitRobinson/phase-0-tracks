####steps for learning some jquery

1. find out what jquery is for (google or wikipedia should be sufficient here)
2. determine a project which would be a good application for this new thing (even just for testing purposes.)
3. find a jquery cheat-sheet
4. plan out the project, researching the parts that will be needed on stack overflow or other resource
5. since it's new, test often, and research when something isn't working.
6. take a break after an hour or so, unless having too much fun.
